how to understand that statistic table result?
To understand the statistic table produced by the woe_discrete function, it can be helpful to look at each of the columns in the table and understand what they represent:

grade: This is the categorical variable being analyzed. In this case, it appears to represent the grade of a loan, with different categories for each letter grade.

n_obs: This column represents the number of observations (i.e., rows in the data) in each category of the categorical variable.

prop_good: This column represents the proportion of observations in each category that are "good," where "good" is defined by the binary target variable. For example, if the target variable represents whether a loan defaults or not, a value of prop_good of 0.8 would mean that 80% of the loans in that category did not default.

prop_n_obs: This column represents the proportion of the total number of observations that are in each category of the categorical variable.

n_good: This column represents the number of "good" observations in each category of the categorical variable. It is calculated as the product of prop_good and n_obs.

n_bad: This column represents the number of "bad" observations in each category of the categorical variable. It is calculated as the difference between n_obs and n_good.

prop_n_good: This column represents the proportion of the total number of "good" observations that are in each category of the categorical variable. It is calculated as the ratio of n_good to the sum of n_good for all categories.

prop_n_bad: This column represents the proportion of the total number of "bad" observations that are in each category of the categorical variable. It is calculated as the ratio of n_bad to the sum of n_bad for all categories.

WoE: This column represents the Weight of Evidence for each category of the categorical variable. It is calculated as the natural logarithm of the ratio of prop_n_good to prop_n_bad.

diff_prop_good: This column represents the absolute difference in the prop_good values between consecutive categories.

diff_WoE: This column represents the absolute difference in the WoE values between consecutive categories.

IV: This column represents the Information Value of the categorical variable. It is calculated as the sum of the product of the absolute difference in the prop_n_good and prop_n_bad values between consecutive categories and the WoE value.

In general, a higher WoE value indicates a stronger association between the categorical variable and the binary target variable, while a higher IV value indicates a stronger overall relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable. By analyzing these values, you can gain insight into how the categories of the categorical variable are related to the binary target variable.
